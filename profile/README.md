## About the Project
In the US K-12 education system, school budgets are often insufficient to cover classroom supplies that teachers need to conduct the activities that would most facilitate student learning. As a result, many teachers compensate by buying supplies themselves or seeking donations from students and their families. To help make this donation process convenient and efficient for both teachers and students, our team will develop a full stack web application that allows teachers to register supply request lists and allows students to make donation commitments. It also allows both teacher and student users to monitor and update donation activity. We feel this is a significant contribution in that many similar classroom donation websites (e.g. DonorsChoose, AdoptAClassroom) are focused on monetary contributions and require that teachers invest much time in the application process. In contrast, our concept offers a simple tool for teachers so that they are able to efficiently request classroom supplies with much less time and effort on the part of the teacher.
